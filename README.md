# JollyRoger
Code for our 2019 Savage Soccer robot. PID, "path following", the works.

## Our robot
- I'm not going to describe what our robot does, because I know my competitors can see this. If you can find out our mechanisms from our functions, good for you.

## Calendar
- Week 1: CAD mechanisms, build chassis, begin PID implementation
- Week 2: Finish initial prototypes, cut parts, make first auto path
### Future:
- Week 3: Redesign, assemble robot, test auto
- Week 4 (LAST WEEK!): Driving practice, reveal video
